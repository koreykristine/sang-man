Guess the song title

The game will load with a blurred image, a random number of blank spaces at the bottom of the page and a prompt on the right that indicates you have 6 incorrect guesses left. 

The user will choose a letter from a box of clickable alpha letters. If the letter matches one of the letters in the randomly selected song title, that letter will appear at the bottom of the screen. 

If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the blurring of the image will reduce and your number of available incorrect guesses will also reduce by one. 

The user wins if they can guess all the correct letters before the image becomes clear and they've made less than 6 incorrect guesses. A winning message and the clear image will populate. If they guess incorrectly 6 times, they will see a loser message.



Stretch goals: 
The winning song will play if you win, a sad loser song will play if you lose?
